""" Sample output from user_stats.py

A sample of vault scores was recorded as [9.4, 9.6, 9.85, 9.55, 9.0, 9.8, 9.2, 8.85, 
9.7, 9.75, 9.45, 9.4, 9.8, 9.7, 9.85, 9.1, 9.45, 9.6, 9.65, 9.35, 9.55, 9.65, 8.5, 
9.3, 9.15, 9.0, 9.6, 9.65, 9.55, 9.8, 9.7, 9.7, 9.4]

The mean vault score is 9.473

The median vault score is 9.55

The mode for the vault scores is 9.7

To give us more information about how spread out the scores were
we have a few more statistics below:

The variance is 0.10

The standard deviation is 0.32

The lowest vault score was 8.5 and the highest vault score was 9.85

Here's some XY data: 
The average number of practice hours is x: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
The average all around score is y: [33.5, 34, 34.3, 35, 35.4, 35.8, 36, 36.4, 36.7, 37.1, 37.3, 37.6]

Calculate the slope and intercept of the best fit line:

slope = 0.25
intercept = 33.11

When x (number of practice hours per week) is 22,
   y (average all around score) is predicted to be 38.53

When x (number of practice hours per week is 24,
   y (average all around score) is predicted to be 39.02
